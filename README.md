# Glitch Hunter

**Glitch Hunter** is a retro-inspired arcade game where you must navigate a glowing maze, collect souls, and escape before the ghost catches you. The game features two unique modes, a full power-up system, and an intelligent AI opponent that will test your skills.

## Features

- **Two Game Modes**: Play as the **Human** (üèÉ) to collect souls and escape, or as the **Ghost** (üëª) to hunt the human.
- **Full Power-Up System**: Use keys **1**, **2**, and **3** to activate unique abilities for each role, like Time Freeze, Phase Dash, Fear Howl, and Shadow Traps.
- **Intelligent AI**: The opponent ghost uses A* pathfinding to intelligently navigate the maze and hunt you down.
- **Challenge Mode**: A competitive 4-round mode where you play as both Human and Ghost, then watch the AI do the same to see who gets the higher score.
- **Retro Visuals**: The game features a Pac-Man-inspired glowing maze, a pulsating escape portal, and character animations.
- **Sound Integration**: The game is ready for sound. You just need to add the audio files (`music.mp3`, `collect.wav`, etc.) to the `sounds` directory.
