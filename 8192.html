        <h2>What is "8192" and What to Do:</h2>
        <p>"8192" is an incredibly addictive and intellectually stimulating number-merge puzzle game that challenges players to combine tiles with identical numbers to reach the elusive 8192 tile. This game operates on a simple 4x4 grid, where numbered tiles slide across the board with each player move. The core objective is to strategically maneuver these tiles, merging pairs of identical numbers (e.g., two '2's merge into a '4', two '4's into an '8', and so on) to progressively create higher-valued tiles. The ultimate goal is to achieve the '8192' tile, a feat that requires significant foresight, planning, and a touch of luck. However, the game doesn't necessarily end there; players can continue to play and aim for even higher scores by creating tiles beyond 8192, pushing the limits of their strategic thinking. Each move introduces a new '2' or '4' tile onto the board, adding an element of unpredictability and requiring constant adaptation. The challenge intensifies as the grid fills up, limiting available moves and demanding careful consideration of every swipe. "8192" is more than just a casual pastime; it's a powerful brain-training exercise that enhances logical reasoning, spatial awareness, and problem-solving skills. Your primary task is to think several steps ahead, anticipating the consequences of each swipe to prevent the board from becoming completely jammed. Success in "8192" is a testament to a player's ability to manage complexity, adapt to changing conditions, and execute a long-term strategy to achieve a high-value tile. It's a game that offers endless replayability and a deeply satisfying sense of intellectual accomplishment.</p>

        <h2>How to Play "8192":</h2>
        <p>Playing "8192" is intuitive, relying on simple swipe mechanics, but mastering it demands strategic depth. The game is played on a 4x4 grid filled with numbered tiles, typically starting with a couple of '2' or '4' tiles. Your primary interaction involves moving all tiles on the board in one of four cardinal directions: up, down, left, or right. This can be done using the arrow keys on a keyboard or by swiping in the desired direction on a touchscreen device. When you make a move, all tiles on the board slide as far as possible in that direction until they hit another tile or the edge of the grid. The crucial mechanic is merging: if two tiles with the same number collide during a slide, they combine into a single new tile with a value that is the sum of the two merged tiles (e.g., two '16's become a '32'). After every move, a new '2' or '4' tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the grid. Your score increases with each merge, corresponding to the value of the new tile created. The game ends when the entire grid is filled with tiles, and there are no more possible moves (i.e., no adjacent tiles with the same number that can be merged, and no empty spaces). To restart the game, you can click the "Restart" button available on the screen. The key to achieving high scores and reaching the 8192 tile is to keep the highest-valued tiles in a corner or along one edge, creating a "snake" or "monument" structure that allows smaller tiles to merge efficiently without blocking critical paths. Avoid making random moves; instead, plan your swipes to create chains of merges and maintain open spaces for new tiles. This strategic approach is vital for long-term success in this captivating puzzle.</p>
