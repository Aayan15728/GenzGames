            <h2>About Get Your Aura</h2>
            <div class="info-section">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Get Your Aura is a playful personality-based browser game designed for the curious and creative minds of Gen Z. It takes a simple concept — aura energy — and turns it into an instant, visual experience that feels part-quiz, part-AI art, and fully fun.

In just a few seconds, you can “reveal your aura” — that glowing energy field that’s said to surround every living being. While traditional aura readings rely on spiritual insight, Get Your Aura re-imagines the process using a light-hearted algorithm that combines your name, birth month, and uploaded photo to create your unique aura color and rating.

Here’s how it works under the hood:
Your name length and birth month are used as playful inputs that map to one of seven aura colors — Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. Each color has its own meaning, mood, and energy intensity, from fiery ambition to calm intuition. The game then generates an aura “rating” — a number symbolizing the strength of your current vibe.

But Get Your Aura isn’t just about numbers. It’s about curiosity, reflection, and a dash of fun self-discovery. Whether you take it seriously or playfully, the moment your aura glows behind your photo feels surprisingly magical. You can screenshot your result, share it with friends, and even compare aura strengths to see who in your group radiates the brightest energy.

No downloads, no sign-ups — just instant play. Get Your Aura is fully browser-based and optimized for phones, tablets, and desktops. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it delivers a smooth, minimalist interface designed to feel intuitive and friendly. Every button, glow, and transition has been tuned for a satisfying “click-and-reveal” moment.

Behind the simple design lies a tiny game of logic, chance, and cosmic curiosity. Players love watching the colorful aura glow emerge over their uploaded photo — it’s part quiz, part personality mirror, and part digital art generator. Whether you’re exploring for fun or showing off your spiritual side, Get Your Aura gives you an instant window into your digital energy.</p>

                <h3>How to Play</h3>
                <p>
                    1. Enter Your Name
Start by typing your name in the input box. This helps personalize your aura — longer names slightly shift the energy value, adding a touch of randomness to the result.

2. Select Your Birth Month
Pick your birth month from the dropdown. Each month carries a hidden “frequency” value that affects your aura’s final color. It’s not astrology — but it’s just as fun to believe your month adds a special twist.

3. Upload a Photo
Choose any clear image from your device. It doesn’t need to be professional — even a selfie works! Once uploaded, your picture will display with a glowing aura overlay that reflects your energy type.

4. Click “Reveal My Aura”
This is the fun part. Watch your photo light up as your aura color and rating appear on the screen. You’ll see:

5. Aura Name (e.g., “Violet”, “Green”, “Red”)

Rating Score (a number showing your aura strength)

A bright aura glow behind your image that visually matches your energy.

Read Your Result & Share It
Each color represents a different personality essence:

Red – Passionate, bold, driven.

Orange – Creative, spontaneous, lively.

Yellow – Optimistic, bright, curious.

Green – Balanced, peaceful, nurturing.

Blue – Intuitive, calm, expressive.

Indigo – Deep-thinking, mysterious, wise.

Violet – Dreamy, imaginative, visionary.

You can take a screenshot and share your results with friends or compare aura strengths to see who glows the most!

6. Try Again Anytime
Use the “Try Again” button to reset the game, upload a new photo, or test different names and months — it’s always a fresh result.

Tips for the best experience:

Use a bright photo with clear lighting.

Try different name variations or nicknames to see subtle aura shifts.
