        <h2>The Hardest Online Games You’ll Rage Quit (Can You Beat Them?)</h2>
        <p>If you think you’ve got quick reflexes and god-tier patience… you’re wrong. 😈</p>
        <p>Welcome to GenZGames’ Impossible Games Collection — a corner of the internet where your sanity takes a vacation, your keyboard cries, and your ego gets humbled faster than you can say “just one more try.”</p>
        <p>No downloads. No ads. Just pure digital pain — free of charge. Let’s see if you can beat even one of these.</p>
        <h3>🎮 1. Flappy Block Impossible</h3>
        <p>“You won’t score 2. We’re not kidding.”</p>
        <p>This isn’t your childhood Flappy Bird. This is the version the bird was too scared to play.</p>
        <p>Built for legends (and masochists), Flappy Block Impossible looks simple but has pixel-perfect hitboxes, brutal gaps, and zero mercy. The average score? 1.3 — because even gravity wants you to lose.</p>
        <p>🕹️ Play Now: <a href="flappyblockimpossible.html">Flappy Block Impossible</a></p>
        <p>💀 Goal: Score 3. If you do, screenshot it — you deserve a medal.</p>
        <h3>🧩 2. 8192: The Brain-Breaking Puzzle</h3>
        <p>“It’s just math,” they said. “It’ll be fun,” they said.</p>
        <p>8192 starts as a relaxing number puzzle… and ends as a slow descent into madness. Every move feels genius — until it ruins everything.</p>
        <p>Think you’re a strategist? Combine your tiles to reach 8192 — or watch your screen fill up with regret.</p>
        <p>🕹️ Play Now: <a href="8192.html">8192 Game</a></p>
        <p>🧠 Goal: Reach 4096 without rage-quitting.</p>
        <h3>🌀 3. Get Your Aura</h3>
        <p>“Your aura reveals your mood. Mine’s black from all the losses.”</p>
        <p>Okay, not every impossible game has to hurt (emotionally). Get Your Aura is your quick test to discover your vibe — but with a GenZ twist. Answer a few rapid-fire questions, and the game analyzes your aura color and energy.</p>
        <p>Perfect for when you’re tired of losing but still want something weirdly addictive.</p>
        <p>🕹️ Play Now: <a href="aura.html">Get Your Aura</a></p>
        <p>✨ Goal: Find your real color — if you dare.</p>
        <h3>🪂 4. The Falling Test (Coming Soon)</h3>
        <p>“How long can you fall before you fall apart?”</p>
        <p>One wrong move, and you plummet into pixel oblivion. A physics-based reflex test that’s equal parts satisfying and infuriating. Currently under construction — but stay tuned, it’ll redefine frustration.</p>
        <p>🕹️ Releasing soon on: GenZGames.com</p>
        <h3>🧠 Why We Built These “Impossible” Games</h3>
