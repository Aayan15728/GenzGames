        <h2>What is "Flappy Block" and What to Do:</h2>
        <p>"Flappy Block" is an incredibly addictive and challenging arcade-style browser game that draws inspiration from the classic "Flappy Bird" phenomenon, reimagined with a unique block-based aesthetic. In this fast-paced game, players control a small, pixelated block that must navigate through a series of vertically scrolling obstacles, typically represented as pipes or gaps. The core objective is to keep the block airborne and guide it through as many gaps as possible without colliding with any of the barriers or touching the ground. This seemingly simple premise belies a high level of difficulty and requires precise timing, quick reflexes, and unwavering concentration. Each successful passage through a gap earns the player a point, and the game continues indefinitely until a collision occurs. The game's minimalist design, coupled with its unforgiving mechanics, creates an intense and highly engaging experience that encourages players to constantly strive for a higher score. Your primary task is to master the "flapping" mechanic, which involves tapping or pressing a key to make the block ascend, and then allowing gravity to pull it down. The rhythm of these actions is crucial for navigating the narrow openings between obstacles. "Flappy Block" is more than just a test of reflexes; it's a lesson in patience and persistence, as players will inevitably face numerous failures before achieving a respectable score. It's a perfect game for quick bursts of entertainment, offering a satisfying challenge for anyone who enjoys high-score chasing and arcade action.</p>

        <h2>How to Play "Flappy Block":</h2>
        <p>Playing "Flappy Block" is straightforward in its controls but demanding in its execution. Upon starting the game, you'll see your block positioned on the left side of the screen, with obstacles slowly approaching from the right. The game begins with a "start-screen" displaying instructions: "Press Space or Tap to Flap." To initiate gameplay, click the "Play" button or simply press the spacebar (or tap on a touchscreen device). Once the game starts, your block will begin to fall due to gravity. To make the block ascend, you must repeatedly press the spacebar or tap the screen. Each press or tap provides a small upward thrust, counteracting gravity. The key to success is to find a consistent rhythm of tapping that allows your block to maintain an altitude that can safely pass through the gaps in the incoming obstacles. The obstacles consist of two vertical segments with an opening in between. You must guide your block through this opening. If your block touches any part of an obstacle or falls to the bottom of the screen, the game ends, and the "game-over-screen" will appear, displaying your "final-score." From this screen, you can click the "Restart" button to begin a new game. A "score-counter" is visible during gameplay, tracking your progress in real-time. The game also includes sound effects for flapping, scoring, and hitting obstacles, enhancing the immersive experience. Mastering "Flappy Block" involves developing a keen sense of timing and anticipating the movement of the obstacles, making it a highly rewarding challenge for those who persevere.</p>

        <h2>About Flappy Block</h2>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h3>Game Overview</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Flappy Block</strong> is a fast-paced online arcade game featured exclusively on 
                <a href="https://genzgames.fun">GenZGames</a>, a trusted destination for fun, free-to-play browser games. 
                It’s a simple concept with an addictive twist — you control a small, colorful block that must navigate through 
                a series of gaps between moving obstacles. With each successful pass, your score climbs higher, but so does 
                the difficulty. The beauty of Flappy Block lies in its simplicity: one tap, endless challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game’s design is inspired by the viral “flap and fly” mechanics that dominated mobile gaming, but 
                it has been reimagined for GenZGames with smooth animations, lightweight code, and zero lag gameplay. 
                Unlike many clones or ad-heavy copies, Flappy Block offers a pure, uninterrupted experience where skill 
                and focus determine your success. Its minimalist art style, clean sound effects, and responsive controls 
                make it both relaxing and nerve-wracking — a true test of reflexes for players of all ages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because Flappy Block is built using optimized <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, it works seamlessly 
                across devices. Whether you’re on a laptop, phone, or tablet, the game adapts instantly to your screen. 
                You don’t need to install anything or sign up — just click, play, and compete against yourself or your friends. 
                Every second in the game is a chance to prove your reaction speed, coordination, and mental focus.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h3>How to Play Flappy Block</h3>
            <p>
                Learning how to play Flappy Block takes only a few seconds — but mastering it could take hours of practice. 
                The objective is simple: keep your block in the air and guide it through the gaps between obstacles without 
                hitting anything. Each successful pass earns you a point, but one wrong move and it’s game over.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Controls:</strong> Tap or click on the screen to make the block jump upward. The longer you hold, 
                the higher it goes. Release, and gravity pulls it down.</li>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Pass through as many gaps as possible without colliding with obstacles or falling off-screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Each successful pass earns one point. The goal is to beat your personal best or challenge friends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Timing is everything. Tap too quickly and your block will rise too high, crashing into an obstacle above. 
                Wait too long and gravity will pull it down before you can recover. The perfect balance lies in rhythm — 
                maintaining a steady beat that matches the flow of the obstacles.
            </p>
            <h4>Pro Tips for Better Scores</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stay Calm:</strong> Don’t panic when the game speeds up. The calmer your hand, the better your rhythm.</li>
                <li><strong>Find Your Flow:</strong> Focus on the space between obstacles rather than the block itself. 
                Your brain adjusts faster when anticipating patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice in Short Sessions:</strong> Short bursts of play improve reaction time better than long marathons.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge Friends:</strong> Competing for high scores makes the game more exciting and improves performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Every attempt sharpens your focus and reflexes. With patience and persistence, you’ll soon start gliding 
                through levels you once thought impossible.
