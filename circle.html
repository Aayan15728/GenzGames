        <h2>About Draw a Perfect Circle</h2>
        <div class="info-section">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                “Draw a Perfect Circle” is a fun, skill-based browser game available to play online at 
                <a href="https://genzgames.fun/draw-a-perfect-circle" target="_blank">GenZGames.fun</a>. 
                Created by <strong>Aayan Sharma</strong>, founder of GenZGames, this game challenges players to do something that sounds easy 
                but is surprisingly difficult — drawing a perfect circle freehand. The idea behind the game is to test your precision, 
                focus, and control while offering a simple yet incredibly engaging experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is straightforward: use your mouse or finger to draw a circle as smooth and accurate as possible. Once you complete the shape, 
                the game instantly scores your attempt and shows how close your drawing is to a perfect circle. It’s a blend of geometry, hand-eye coordination, 
                and patience — wrapped in a minimalist and calming interface that anyone can enjoy. The clean design and fast loading time make it perfect for 
                casual players, students, and even artists who love testing their steady hands.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes “Draw a Perfect Circle” stand out is its simplicity. There are no complex rules, no heavy graphics, and no downloads required. 
                It’s lightweight, smooth, and playable on both desktop and mobile browsers. Players find themselves repeatedly trying to improve their score, 
                pushing for that elusive 100% perfect circle. It’s both relaxing and challenging — a perfect example of how minimal games can be deeply addictive 
                when done right.

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <p>
                1. Visit <a href="https://genzgames.fun/draw-a-perfect-circle" target="_blank">GenZGames.fun/draw-a-perfect-circle</a>.<br>
                2. Once the game loads, click and hold your mouse button (or tap on mobile) to start drawing.<br>
                3. Move your hand slowly in a circular motion and try to meet the starting point without breaking the line.<br>
                4. Release to finish your circle. The game will automatically score your drawing.<br>
                5. Try again to beat your accuracy score!
            </p>
            <p>
                The key is maintaining a steady motion — fast movements often create jagged or uneven circles. Many players find that practicing a few times 
                helps them understand the motion better. You can also zoom in slightly for improved control. Since the game measures precision mathematically, 
                even small improvements can make a big difference in your score.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Draw a Perfect Circle” isn’t just a casual test of drawing — it’s also a great exercise for focus, concentration, and fine motor control. 
                Many users compare it to a mini mindfulness exercise because it encourages you to slow down, control your hand movements, and stay present.
