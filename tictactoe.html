        <h2>What is "Tic Tac Toe" and What to Do:</h2>
        <p>"Tic Tac Toe" is a timeless and universally beloved strategy game, now available in a versatile online format that allows you to challenge either a human opponent or a sophisticated AI. At its core, Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective for both players, typically designated as "X" and "O," is to be the first to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. This seemingly straightforward goal belies a surprising depth of tactical thinking, especially when playing against a skilled adversary. Players must not only focus on creating their own winning lines but also on blocking their opponent's potential victories. Each move requires careful consideration, balancing offensive plays with defensive maneuvers. The game is an excellent exercise in pattern recognition, foresight, and quick decision-making. Whether you're looking for a casual brain teaser or a competitive match, "Tic Tac Toe" offers instant fun and a satisfying mental workout. Your primary task is to strategically place your mark on the grid, anticipating your opponent's moves and planning several steps ahead to secure a line of three before they do. The game's digital format enhances accessibility, allowing for seamless play anytime, anywhere, and providing a perfect blend of simplicity and strategic depth that has captivated generations of players. It's more than just a game; it's a fundamental lesson in basic strategy and competitive thinking.</p>

        <h2>How to Play "Tic Tac Toe":</h2>
        <p>Playing "Tic Tac Toe" on this platform is designed for ease and flexibility, offering both "Human vs Human" and "Human vs AI" modes. Upon launching the game, you'll first encounter a mode selection screen where you can choose your preferred opponent. If you select "Human vs Human," two players can take turns on the same device, making it a great option for shared fun. If you opt for "Human vs AI," you'll face a computer opponent, providing a consistent challenge. Once a mode is selected, the game board, a 3x3 grid of nine clickable cells, will appear. The "turn-display" will indicate whose turn it is, typically starting with Player X. To make a move, simply click on any empty cell on the board. Your mark (either "X" or "O") will then appear in that cell. The game alternates turns between players. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. As you play, keep an eye on both your opportunities to create a winning line and your opponent's potential winning lines, which you must block. If all nine cells are filled and neither player has achieved three in a row, the game is declared a draw. After each game concludes, a "result-popup" will appear, displaying the outcome (e.g., "Player X Wins!", "It's a Draw!"). From this popup, you can easily click the "Play Again" button to start a new game, either with the same mode or by returning to the mode selection. The intuitive interface ensures that even newcomers can quickly grasp the mechanics and dive into the strategic fun.</p>
